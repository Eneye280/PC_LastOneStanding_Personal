  descriptionPlayer: 'In biology, the skeletal system or skeleton is the biological
    system that provides support, support and protection to the soft tissues and
    muscles in living organisms. The skeletal system has locomotion, support and
    protection functions. Vertebrates have an internal skeleton or endoskeleton,
    made up of bones, which are joined together by the joints. The science that deals
    with studying bones is called osteology. '
