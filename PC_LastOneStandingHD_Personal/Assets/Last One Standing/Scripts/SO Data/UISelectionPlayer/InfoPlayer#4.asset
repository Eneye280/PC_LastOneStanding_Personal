  namePlayer: Orco
  descriptionPlayer: "Orc is the deformation of a term, derived from Old English,
    which referred to numerous monsters in Celtic mythology. The existence of these
    creatures was invented to explain the events of blood and assaults that occurred
    in the fields and forests. In Spanish the word has evolved as \xABogre\xBB. In
    Roman mythology the word Orcus (\"Orc\") is synonymous with the underworld and
    is sometimes also the name of a giant son of the god Pluto. The Castilian word
    derived from the Latin is Huerco.\r\n"
