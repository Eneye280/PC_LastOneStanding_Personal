  descriptionPlayer: 'Toads (Bufonidae) are a family of the order Anura, a class
    of known amphibians. Many of their species are known by the common name of toads;
    however, numerous species belonging to other families are also commonly called
    toads. This is so because the characteristics that are popularly used to distinguish
    frogs from toads are not the same as those used in scientific classification. '
